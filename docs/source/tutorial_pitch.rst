***********************************
Tutorial 5: Pitch extraction
***********************************

The main objective of this tutorial is to perform pitch extraction on the enriched polyglot corpus we used in the previous four tutorials.

As in the other tutorials, import statements and the corpus name (as it is stored in pgdb) must be set for the code in this tutorial
to be runnable:

.. code-block:: python

    from polyglotdb import CorpusContext

    corpus_name = 'tutorial-subset'

First steps
=========================

Coming soon!
