***********************************
Tutorial 4: Verb formant analysis
***********************************

The main objective of this tutorial is to perform verb formant analysis on the enriched polyglot corpus we used in the previous three tutorials.

As in the other tutorials, import statements and the corpus name (as it is stored in pgdb) must be set for the code in this tutorial
to be runnable:

.. code-block:: python

    from polyglotdb import CorpusContext

    corpus_name = 'tutorial-subset'

First steps
=========================

Coming soon!
