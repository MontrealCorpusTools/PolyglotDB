These tutorials walk you through the basic workflow of using PolyglotDB, from setting up a corpus to extracting acoustic measurements. 

**Tutorials 1–3** form a complete analysis and should be done in order. They show you how to import a small speech corpus, enrich it with information like syllables and utterances, and extract structured results.

**Tutorials 4-6** are independent. They cover additional types of acoustic analysis—formant tracking for vowels, pitch analysis, and applying a custom Praat script (to analyze voice quality, in this example). You can do these in any order.

Before doing any tutorial you need to download one or both tutorial corpora. 

For all tutorials, you can compare your results with the `expected output`_.

If at any point there’s some error or interruption in import or other stages of the tutorial, you should :ref:`reset the database<resetting>`.
