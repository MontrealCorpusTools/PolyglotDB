Prerequisites
=============

PolyglotDB uses Neo4j to represent its annotation graphs.  Before installing
PolyglotDB, download and install the Neo4j Community edition
(http://neo4j.com/download/).

Once Neo4j is installed, start the server and go to http://localhost:7474/.
The first time, Neo4j will prompt you to set a password for future connections.

PolyglotDB currently only supports SQLite for its relational database component,
which requires no extra installation.
In the future, more sophisticated relational database servers will be supported.
