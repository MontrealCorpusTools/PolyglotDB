PolyglotDB is a Python package for storing, phonetically analyzing, and querying speech corpora. It can be used with corpora of any size, and is built to scale to very large corpora.  It constructs a "polyglot" NoSQL database mirroring the structure of phonetic data, and has a consistent Python API for interacting with the underlying databases.  The online documentation is
available at http://polyglotdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
