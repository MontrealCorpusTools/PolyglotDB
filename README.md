PolyglotDB is a Python package for storing and querying large speech corpora.  It constructs various kinds of database,
and has a consistent Python API for interacting with the various underlying databases.  The online documentation is
available at http://polyglotdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

This package is intended for developers and those experienced with scripting in Python.  If you would like to use a
graphical interface for querying and interacting with PolyglotDB databases, please see Speech Corpus Tools
(http://speech-corpus-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  Speech Corpus Tools is currently depreciated and undergoing
significant update to match recent development of PolyglotDB.
